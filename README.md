# My data science and programming practices 

This is Matt Najarian and I have been working on data science and optimization for 7 years. Currently I am a lead data scientists working on IoT projects. 
I have gathered some notebooks, codes, and notes that I share here; as a reference for myself, and mybe as some guides for visitors.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, I will refer you to useful links that you may find useful. There are two websites that have useful cheat sheets for data scientist: </br>
1- https://www.mit.edu/~amidi/teaching/ </br>
2- https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/

# My personal cluster:
One of my hobbies is working with my cluster. I have 3 PCs that I have installed several applications and platforms:
- Apache SuperSet (visit [lohrasp.com](http://lohrasp.com/))
- Hadoop
- Spark 3
- The current demo application (visit [projects.lohrasp.com](http://projects.lohrasp.com/))
- PostgreSQL 14.0 and PgAdmin 4

# Apache Spark / Databricks
As I learned spark, I decided to share what I learned both for my own reference future readers.
<li>Spark installation
<li>RDD
<li>DataFrame
<li>MLIB

# TensorFlow/Keras
During my Ph.D. studies, with two of my friends we tutored TensorFlow. Check the following links for more information:

# Python Tips and Projects

In in the <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/python_codes/">python_codes</a> subdirectory, I have included some of my personal and educational projects. Here is a list of items you will find: 

- <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/blob/master/python_codes/python_cheat_sheet.ipynb"> Python cheat sheet</a>: I have noted down some tips and tricks while working on different projects which can be useful to you. 

- <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/python_codes/unit_commitment" style="bold">Security Constrained Unit Commitment</a>: Unit Commitment is the process of turning on (committing) resources to meet load and other market requirements. â€¢ Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) commits units (electricity generators). while respecting limitations of the transmission system and unit. I have coded it in <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/Java_and_CPP/unit_commitment_Java">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/python_codes/unit_commitment">Python</a>. 

- <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/python_codes/investment">Maximizing Infrastructure Resiliency Under Budgetary Constraint</a>: it is crucial for investment on resiliency to distribute budget among different resources, in a way that the effect is maximized. Check my paper in the following link:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0951832019308336

- <a href="https://github.com/lohraspco/data-science/tree/master/python_codes/component_importance">Component Importance</a>: at the time of recovery from a disaster, some components play a more important. This is an ongoing research of mine to find those components. The codes include cool visualization (<a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>) and random graph generation codes.
