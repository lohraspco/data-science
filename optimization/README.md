I have developed mathematical programming models in C++, Java, and Python and solved them using Gurobi and CPLEX solvers. 
# Python
In this folder you will find my codes that are developed for my thesis and I have included my papers here

- [investment](./python/investment_py) folder contains Python code which uses gurobipy library for optimization. It is a code used in the following paper: </br>
  	M. Najarian and G. J. Lim, Optimizing Infrastructure Resilience Under Budgetary Constraint, Reliability Engineering and System Safety 198, June 2020.</br>
- [component_importance_py](./python/component_importance_py) folder contains optimization and codes used in the following paper (not published yet): </br>
  	M. Najarian and G. J. Lim, A Path Generation and Initial Solution Strategy to the Multi-Arc Disruption with Maximum Impact on Network Flow.</br>
- [unit_commitment_py](./python/unit_commitment_py) folder contains codes used in the following paper: </br>
   	M. Najarian, G. J. Lim, and M. Barati, Levelized Resiliency Assessment of Interdependent Natural Gas and Electric Power Systems, Proceedings of the 2018 IISE Annual Conference, May 2018.


# Java
The folder java/unit_commitment_Jaav folder contain an implementation of  security constrained unit commitment optimization problem in java using solvers CPLEX and Gurobi. 

codes in Java. 
- unit_commitment_java 

# C++
Folder cpp/stochastic_programming_CPP contain my code in C++ which implements an iterative algorithm that calls  IBM CPLEX API for optimization in its iterations to solve a special type of electricity market problem. Here is a link to the a [paper draft](./cpp/stochastic_programming_CPP/bidding%20strategy%2020160125-1.docx) that is not submitted yet.
